Project Idea
-------------------
My Blogger App will be an app for users to write blog posts and view blog posts by others. They will be able to interact with 
other users through likes/ comments. They can even save articles to read for later. 


User Stories
1. User can make an account --> DONE
2. User can view blogs written by other users
3. User can like a blog
4. User can comment on a blog
5. User can view individual blog (need blog show page)
6. User can delete their own blogs
7. User can edit their own blogs
8. User can save an article to read for later --> stretch goal
9. User can search for article by tags --> stretch goal.

Stretch Goals:
1. User can login, would like to implement Authentication
2. User can view information on other users (user show page)
3. User can reply to comments, and like comments
4. Save preferences on the kind of articles you'd like to see when you open the app
